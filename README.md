# COVID DNA Sequencer

The COVID DNA Sequencer project is designed to sequence and analyze the DNA of the COVID-19 virus, providing insights into its genetic structure. This project involves identifying open reading frames (ORFs) in the virus's genome and translating these sequences into their corresponding amino acid chains.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on:

1. **Finding Open Reading Frames (ORFs)**:
   - ORFs are identified by locating start codons (`ATG` in DNA or `AUG` in RNA) and stop codons (`TGA`, `TAA`, `TAG` in DNA or `UGA`, `UAA`, `UAG` in RNA).
   - The `find_orfs()` function scans the genome sequence to locate these codons and extracts the corresponding ORFs.

2. **ORF Class**:
   - Each ORF found is stored as an object with attributes like the ORF number, base pairs, start and stop positions, and the sequence itself.
   - The class also includes a `transcribe()` method to convert the ORF into a protein sequence by translating each codon into its corresponding amino acid.

3. **Codon-Amino Acid Mapping**:
   - A dictionary maps each codon to its corresponding amino acid, which is used in the transcription process.

## Key Features

- **Genome Sequence Analysis**: Tools to identify and analyze ORFs in a given DNA/RNA sequence.
- **Transcription**: Converting nucleotide sequences into protein sequences based on standard genetic codes.
- **Data Visualization**: (Optional) Visualization of the results, such as plotting the positions of ORFs on the genome.

## Code Structure

- `find_orfs()`: Function to locate ORFs in the genome sequence.
- `ORF`: Class representing an open reading frame, including attributes like sequence and methods for transcription.
- Codon mapping dictionary: Used for translating nucleotide sequences into amino acids.

## Usage

This project can be used to study the genetic structure of the COVID-19 virus and other similar viruses. It provides foundational tools for genetic analysis and can be expanded with additional functionalities like mutation analysis and comparative genomics.
